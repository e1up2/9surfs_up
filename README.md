# Overview of Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze data concerning temperature and precipatation in O'ahu Hawaii. I was given this task so that my business partner, W. Avy, could present the viualized data to a board of investors so that we can open up an ice cream shop on the beach.


# Results

## Analysis
1. When looking at the temperatures in June and December, you'll notice that the average temperatures are within four degrees of each other. This leads me to believe that, based on temperature only, that it woouldnt make difference if the store was open in June and December. Again, this is only based on temperature. Looking at the precipitaion could completely change this opinion.

2. For the month of June, I was able to get about 2,000 more values to use for research than I was for the month of December. This could mean that June's data is significantly more accurate than December.

3. For both June and December, I returned a standard deviation of above 3. This could also be an issue when it comes to the accuracy of my conclusions because a "good" standard deviation is usually considered to be within + or - 2.


## Summary
I believe that it would be just ok to have the store open during these months and I think it would be better to have it open on months where the average temperature is above 80 degrees.
